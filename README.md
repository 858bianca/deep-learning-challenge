# deep-learning-challenge

# Background:
For this challenge a nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soups wants a tool to help select applicants for funding that have the best chances of success in their ventures. Using my knowledge in machine learning and neural network, my task is to build, train, and optimize a deep learning model to predict the success rate of applicants. 

# Analysis:
To complete this task, it is broken into 3 parts:
