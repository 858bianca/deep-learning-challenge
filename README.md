# deep-learning-challenge

# Background:
For this challenge a nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soups wants a tool to help select applicants for funding that have the best chances of success in their ventures. Using my knowledge in machine learning and neural network, my task is to build, train, and optimize a deep learning model to predict the success rate of applicants. 

# Analysis:
To complete this task, it is broken into 3 parts:
- Preprocess the Data
   Using Pandas and scikit-learn's StandardScaler to aid in preprocessing the dataset. Doing this will help compile, train and evaluate the neural network model in the next task. 
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
  In this step, I used TensorFlow to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. This is done by designing a neural network, training it and than evaluating the model to determine the loss and accuracy. 
- Optimize the Model
  After deasigning a working a neural network, the code was duplicated twice to optimize the model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%
